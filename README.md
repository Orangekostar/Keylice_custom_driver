After downloading and extracting the files, proceed to run the local server program according to the following methods for different versions:

Windows 64-bit: Double-click on the "lkb-configurator-server.exe" file to directly open and execute it.

macOS 64-bit: In the extracted folder, open the Terminal application. Then, follow these steps:

Type chmod +x ./lkb-configurator-server into the terminal and press Enter. This command grants executable permissions to the file.
Next, type ./lkb-configurator-server and hit Enter to launch the local server.
If you are not currently in the extracted folder within the Terminal, please use the full path for the commands as follows:

To grant permissions: chmod +x /users/name/lkb-configurator-server
To run the local server: sudo /users/name/lkb-configurator-server (Note: You may need to use sudo to run the server with administrative privileges depending on the file's settings and your system configuration.)
